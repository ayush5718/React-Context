# React Context API and useEffect Lifecycle Method with Dynamic Routing

This repository contains code examples and explanations for learning React's Context API, `useEffect` lifecycle method, and dynamic routing.

## Context API

The Context API in React provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is useful for sharing state between components that are not directly connected.

In this repository, you will find examples of how to create and use context providers and consumers, allowing components to access shared state or functionality.

## useEffect Lifecycle Method

The `useEffect` hook in React allows performing side effects in functional components. It is similar to `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods combined.

This repository includes examples demonstrating how to use `useEffect` to fetch data from APIs, subscribe to events, or perform other side effects.

## Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routing in React enables building applications with multiple pages or views where the routing configuration is determined dynamically based on data or user input.

You'll find examples illustrating how to implement dynamic routing using libraries like React Router. This includes setting up routes dynamically based on data and handling route parameters.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/ayush5718/React-Context.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd React-Context`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Explore the code examples and documentation in the repository to understand how Context API, `useEffect`, and dynamic routing are implemented.
5. Experiment with the code by making changes and running the application locally.
6. Have fun learning and building with React!
